# Machine Learning

This repository contains codes of various ML technologies that I learned by doing some mini-projects.

Table of contents:
1. First attempt at making a self-learning neural network using only numpy matrices, includes backward propagation and stuff like that.
2. Finding out on how validation set and test set work on different linear regression parameters.
3. Learning SVM by testing different parameters and kernels and then making a simple spam classifier using given data.
4. Deepening the secrets of K-Means algorithm by writing a code that performs image compression.
